fmt.Printf Note:
  When you place a number between % and v you will pad the number of spaces
    to the left (+) or left (-)

var() Gives you a nice place to store all variables for a function
  Before declaring variables as a group make sure they are all related
    as to not degrade readability

Incrementing
  var *= x instead of var = var * x
  var += x
    var += 1 is var++
  var /= x instead of var = var / x
  var -= x
    var -= 1 is var--

Boolean Shorthand
if var  checks if var is true
if !var checks if var is false
